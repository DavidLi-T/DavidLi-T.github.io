	<p>I am a postdoctoral research fellow actively pursuing a tenure-track faculty position in bioengineering, mechanical engineering, biology, and related fields in engineering and medical schools. I am interested in studying the biomechanics and mechanobiology of cells and tissues, and especially in how these fields intersect with other aspects of biomedicine such as metabolism. As a biomedical engineer, I hope to translate these findings into novel diagnostics and therapeutics, taking advantage of my unique combination of training in specialized imaging and biocompatible microfabrication.
	
	<p>I am conducting research in the lab of Dr. Rebecca G. Wells at the University of Pennsylvania with a current focus on the relationship between histological features, lipid crystallization, and stiffness in hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, and have received both an NRSA T32 Postdoctoral Fellowship Award and the 2023 Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Award from the American Liver Foundation for my recent work.</p>

	<p>Working with Dr. Wells and Dr. Paul A. Janmey, I developed a technique to associate tissue mechanics with histology at the mesoscale, and have published in <em>FASEB Bioadvances</em> how liver fat accumulation causes softening on the macro and meso scales. In my doctoral work with Dr. Yu-li Wang at Carnegie Mellon University, I discovered that cells coordinate collective movement through Wnt signaling, published in <em>PNAS</em>. While training with Dr. Joyce Y. Wong at Boston University, I studied biomimetic microfabrication of silk with Dr. David. L. Kaplan, published in <em>Biofabrication</em>.</p>
