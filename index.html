	<p>I am a postdoctoral research fellow actively pursuing a tenure-track faculty position in bioengineering, mechanical engineering, biology, and related fields in engineering and medical schools. I am interested in studying the biomechanics and mechanobiology of cells and tissues, and especially in how these fields intersect with other aspects of biomedicine such as metabolism. As a biomedical engineer, I hope to translate these findings into novel diagnostics and therapeutics, taking advantage of my unique combination of training in specialized imaging and biocompatible microfabrication.
	
	<p>I am conducting research in the lab of Dr. <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p26645" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rebecca G. Wells</a> at the University of Pennsylvania with a current focus on the relationship between histological features, lipid crystallization, and stiffness in hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, and have received both an <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/pWzDIB8gMUG9nvBD-0KSPw/projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NRSA T32 Postdoctoral Fellowship Award</a> and the <a href="https://liverfoundation.org/medical-professionals/research-awards-program/postdoctoral-fellowships/david-li/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023 Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Award from the American Liver Foundation</a> for my recent work.</p>

	<p>Working with Dr. Wells and in collaboration with Dr. <a href="https://cdb.med.upenn.edu/people/paul-a-janmey-ph-d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul A. Janmey</a>, I developed a technique to associate tissue mechanics with histology at the mesoscale, and have published in <em>FASEB Bioadvances</em> how liver fat accumulation causes softening on the macro and meso scales. In my doctoral work with Dr. <a href="https://yuliwang.bme.cmu.edu/People/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yu-li Wang</a> at Carnegie Mellon University, I discovered that cells coordinate collective movement through Wnt signaling, published in <em>PNAS</em>. While training with Dr. <a href="https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/joyce-y-wong-ph-d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joyce Y. Wong</a> at Boston University, I studied biomimetic microfabrication of silk in collaboration with Dr. <a href="https://facultyprofiles.tufts.edu/david-kaplan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David. L. Kaplan</a>, published in <em>Biofabrication</em>.</p>
